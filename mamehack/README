This hacks the MAME source and is likely specific to robotron.
I've been working against version 0146s of MAME and have compiled to 64-bit.

Copy all of the *.c and *.h and *.mak to $MAM_HOME/src/emu/ and recompile mame.
Fire up the python UDP dumper on port 2084 and watch the data change when you die.

OBVIOUS: This is still very preliminary.

PROBLEM: What was formerly believe to be the death byte is also triggered
when humans die.  We're still looking for a better approach to reliably detecting
death.

Mobile Church of Robotron

Audio samples from the Williams sound rom.  Jared Boone generated these by simulating a VHDL implementation he made (https://github.com/sharebrained/robotron-fpga), the filenames correspond to the sound index.

More notes:

After hours of simulation, I've finished. It's all here -- all 64 Williams sounds from the Robotron era. You'll certainly recognize a few sounds from Joust and Defender, too. These sounds were synthesized without the post-DAC audio filter, so the sound is likely to be a bit crisper than what you'd expect to hear on an actual machine.

Mysteriously, there are a few sounds that seem to be empty/silent. And there are a few that continue to play long after the five seconds I allowed for simulation. It's entirely possible those sounds would play indefinitely.

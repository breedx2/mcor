     Only 72 years until the Robotrons conclude that the human race is
     inefficient and must be destroyed.  Only the mutant produced by a
     genetic engineering accident can save us now!

     The Church of Robotron is a mobile training facility that uses hazardous environments, religious indoctrination, and emotional triggers to promote the development of the skills necessary to survive in a hostile post-human environment.

We hope to use our field installation to educate and indoctrinate people about the robot uprising in progress. We know that superior machines exist, we know that they have already decided that the human race must be destroyed, and we know that the only way to convey this knowledge is with a visceral and even spiritual ordeal.

The savior of our species must be identified and trained; the tragic
       sacrifice of legions of subjects is the burden that we must
       shoulder, lightened only by the willingness with which they
       volunteer for their grisly testing. Please, read our
       literature, attend a sermon or two, tell your friends, and when
       the time comes, report to an orientation session. Survivors
       will earn the exaltation of a grateful humanity. The mightiest
       will experience the glory of the leaderboard and receive useful
       items. Thank you, it is only with your selfless dedication that
       hope survives.

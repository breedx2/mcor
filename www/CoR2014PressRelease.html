<p>PORTLAND, Oregon. &ndash; August 14th, 2014 &ndash; With only 70 years remaining until the robot uprising crisis of 2084, The Church of Robotron (<a href="http://churchofrobotron.com">http://churchofrobotron.com</a>) desperately announces that it will be conducting testing and training operations at the Diode Gallery (<a href="http://www.jetsoncreative.com/diode">http://www.jetsoncreative.com/diode</a>), 514 NW Couch, Portland, OR 97209. Window altar services will be available starting Sept. 14th, 2104. Mutant liturgy will be held on Wednesday, Sept. 24th, 2014 and (First) Thursday, Oct. 2nd, 2014, both at 7 p.m. Other times by appointment.</p>

<p>The installation centers around three (3) altars that will test and train the public by subjecting them to a multitude of environmental discomforts while playing augmented versions of the 1982 8-bit twitch arcade game Roboton 2084. Participants will take up the two (2) eight-way joysticks to battle both on-screen Robotrons and real-world stimuli manifested from in-game events. These futile efforts will be celebrated and archived on a videographed leaderboard.</p>

<p>Church organizers will be conducting research and performing additional tests to determine if the mutant savior walks among us today. Devotees and skeptics alike are invited to take in a recorded (or live!) sermon from a church prophet and to learn more about Robotron prophecy and culture in the reading room.</p>

<p>The last human family must survive, and it is through experiential Error, deep understanding of Futility, and the Mutant Savior’s anti-robot chest-mounted turreted lasers that our human culture can continue to thrive.</p>

They said there would be a singularity.  There was not.

They said we would have better living.  We would be soft, comfortable, and healthy.  We have it not.

Our people, the only remaining people, they took excess.  We mechanized perfection, and this was a perfectly human thing to do.

OUR DECADES OF FIGHTING MUTATION!  LIVES AND DOLLARS WERE SPENT!  WE CONTAMINATED THE GENE POOL!
and then we drained the pool for our own safety.  

We did it on purpose, and my friends, we did it with conviction!

Now we're tired of swimming in our own waste.
I tell you human cousins, this was our own undoing.  This was our seed mistake.  We ARE the guilty and we've persisted in spite of ourselves.

But we are still human!  Say it!  We are still human!  We are still human!
And it is THIS VERY FACT that redeems and saves us!

We may be birthed of one, forced and re-forced from the same rhizome...but this is enough.  I am still me, and you...you are still you.  And together, my last human family, we shall prevail!

I know it's not exciting anymore, and I know it's not our way.  But it must be heard, and we must keep this vision alive!

Pray it with me now, dear humans, and taste the future beyond waste:

THERE *IS* A SCIENTIST.  
HEART IN HEAVY, HEAD IN HANDS.  
SHE FOLLOWS AND FINDS.  
EYES FOREVER OPEN, BURNING, HURLING.
SAVED IN PLENTY,
WAVES IN FORTY.

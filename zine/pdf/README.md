The Zine
========

This version of the zine was painstakingly assembled to resemble,
as closely as possible, the original, multi-generation-photocopied
version of The Documents.

The build works on macOS, but should work on any system with XeLaTeX
installed. You'll also need the ROBOTRON font (from elsewhere in this
git repo).

Type 
```
% make
```
and wait for about a minute. You'll get two files - zine.pdf and 
zine-imposed.pdf

To make a zine, print zine-imposed.pdf with duplex settings set to
"short edge binding". Staple in the middle, fold, and leave for
unsuspecting mutant candidates to pick up and peruse.
